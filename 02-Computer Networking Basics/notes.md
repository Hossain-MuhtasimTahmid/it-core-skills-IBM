# Networking
* When many groups of devices are connected to each other in a way that they can share data and resources between each other, they form a network.
  * Modem is required to talk to the Internet and a Router is required to help manage the traffic.

* Data is transferred across networks in packets. --> A large file (like a video, which can be many gigabytes) can be broken down into very small chunks called data packets. The network can transfer each chunk separately and networking resources can reassemble them on the receiving side.
* Wireless fidelity (wifi) networks transmit data using radio signals.
* Radio technology. A radio sends and receives information in electromagnetic sound waves.
