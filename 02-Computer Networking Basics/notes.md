# Networking
* When many groups of devices are connected to each other in a way that they can share data and resources between each other, they form a network.
  * Modem is required to talk to the Internet and a Router is required to help manage the traffic.

* Data is transferred across networks in packets. --> A large file (like a video, which can be many gigabytes) can be broken down into very small chunks called data packets. The network can transfer each chunk separately and networking resources can reassemble them on the receiving side.
* Wireless fidelity (wifi) networks transmit data using radio signals.
* Radio technology. A radio sends and receives information in electromagnetic sound waves.
* Router(connected to the Internet Service Provider & sends data)-> home or school network.-->
  * A box that manages network traffic between the device and the internet.
* Network Interface Controller (NIC)-> wired network (hardware)->to send and receive data to the connected computer.
* Mobile Phone-> Radio hardware -> sends and receives data from cell towers.
* Modem-> Modulate + Demodulate-> Modulate is sending/transmitting & demodulate is receiving/demodulating. -->
  * Computer part that conncets to an internet service and it might be an external box or an internal card.
* Gateway-> A box that contains both modem and router.
* Internet servers (Data)-> Modem -> Router -> The devices

* Media Access Control (MAC)-> Globally unique and cannot be same (ex: passport number)
* Internet Protocol (IP)-> Not unique-> indentifies devices on a perticular network.

* QUIZ 1-->
  * The large data gets broken down into small packets, and each packet is sent separately and then reassembled on the receiving side.
  * When you send a message from your home, data travels to your router, which routes the message to the internet and then to the routers of the people in your group.
  * On a private network like a home, business, or school network, the router assigns all the devices on that network an individual IP address that is associated with the device’s MAC address.

* PANs- Personal Area Network, from the name itself I can undersatnd that it has to be used on a personal level, the devices need to be in the same place.
* LANs- Local Area Network, mainly used by corporations or at home or at shops or cafes' to have private network connection, so no random person can access without permission.
* WANs- Wide Area Network, the internet is called the open WAN because it covers the world and devices don't need permission to access it, but some networks which require security credentials are called closed networks.
* VPNs- Virtual Private Networks, it works like a tunnel from one LAN to another so sometines people working remotely can use vpn to access to private LANs of their company or schools.
* QUIZ 2-->
  * A local area network (LAN) the secure way to let some people in and keep others out.
  * A personal area network (PAN) is ideal for transferring a single image to a nearby device.
  * Routers transmit traffic from one side of a network or device to the other side of the network or device.
