-In 1930s, Alan Turing (a mathematician) came up with the idea of digital computer and discovered that computaional work can be done with just 2 digits (0 and 1)- these are called bit.
-These bits can represent different states like on or off. And bits are exponential, the more we have it the more states we can represent.
-Turings binary system measurements-->Bit, Byte (8 bits), Kilobyte ( 2 e10), Megabyte (2 e20), Gigabyte (2 e30).
-In 1989 Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee introduced the World Wide Web. Berners-Lee developed the first browser and the first web server.
# Quiz 1--> 
-The combination of bits, which is exponential, provides computing with tremendous power.
-Computer technology evolved from calculating machines to mainframes to personal computing devices.
-IT departments support company-issued computers and technology used for daily operations.
-The information system of resources is the World Wide Web.
-The operating system is the special software that makes the computer work and controls its operations.
