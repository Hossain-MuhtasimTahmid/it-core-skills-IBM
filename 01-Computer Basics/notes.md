# Computer Basics (January 28-2026)
* In 1930s, Alan Turing (a mathematician) came up with the idea of digital computer and discovered that computaional work can be done with just 2 digits (0 and 1)- these are called bit.
* These bits can represent different states like on or off. And bits are exponential, the more we have it the more states we can represent.
* Turings binary system measurements-->Bit, Byte (8 bits), Kilobyte ( 2 e10), Megabyte (2 e20), Gigabyte (2 e30).
* In 1989 Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee introduced the World Wide Web. Berners-Lee developed the first browser and the first web server.
# Quiz 1--> 
* The combination of bits, which is exponential, provides computing with tremendous power.
* Computer technology evolved from calculating machines to mainframes to personal computing devices.
* IT departments support company-issued computers and technology used for daily operations.
* The information system of resources is the World Wide Web.
* The operating system is the special software that makes the computer work and controls its operations.

# Parts of the computer (Quiz 2)
* The CPU handles most of the processing, which makes it the “brains” of the computer.
* RAM is short-term storage for processes and applications that are in use. It is like a list because it makes the information readily accessible for the processing unit.
* The network adapter retrieves data from other computers in the network.
* The GPU is optimized to handle complex graphical processing of what you see on your screen. Typically, visual mathematical problems require complex processing.
* The HDD is where applications and files are stored, along with the operating system.

# Cloud Computing
* Cloud computing in simple terms is a large collection of computers working together using the internet to communicate.
  *QUIZ 3-->
   * Scalability is handling the change in demand for power and storage. Without scalability the number and frequency of requests from fans who want to buy tickets might cause the ticket website to crash.
   * East is using local computing and West is using cloud computing. East has a room with several computers performing the same jobs as the single computer that West is using. West can connect to the cloud from one computer. East is connecting several computers only in a local network.
   * Each cloud computer handles its own workload.
   * Scientists discovered that they might use more power when needed and save on power costs by distributing jobs across computer hardware.
   * Cloud computing basically means that a large collection of computers are working together using the internet to communicate.

# Harware & Software
* Hardware is the physical components that computers need to operate. The CPU, RAM, and the NIC all are examples of hardware. Hardware, while powerful, isn’t very smart without instructions to tell it what to work on.
* Software is the instructions that tell the hardware what data to process, what to show on a screen, or what information to send to the internet.
* QUIZ 4-->
   * Hardware uses the instructions from software to turn on and off the switches. The changes create a combination of ones and zeroes that the computer uses to perform the task.
   * The cloud version is able to leverage more power than your local version to run the operation.
   * A software program follows your instructions to send the email.
   * Cloud storage allows you to upload your photos to a single location. You can then send your friends a link so they can access the files without having to download them to their devices.

# Identity & Security
* Operating systems: The managers 
  * Operating systems are the software that acts as a host for other software and manages all the hardware.
* Cloud computers can also pass through identity from one system to another. This is single sign-on (SSO). So, if you log into your social media profile, that service tells the music company to trust you. Your identity is verified by your social media provider and then passed through to the music service.
* Biometrics because they use your unique biology to identify you.
* Gait analysis. This type of system would use artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze how you walk and uniquely identify you based on your particular walking patterns.
